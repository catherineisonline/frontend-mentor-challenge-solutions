## About The Project

The main challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

A great project to practice some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
