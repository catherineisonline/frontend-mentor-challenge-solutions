## About The Project

<p>This project is great if you're starting to get confident with slightly more complex layouts. The second section with the testimonial area will provide a nice challenge.

<br><br>Users should be able to: <br>

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover and focus states for interactive elements.
   <br>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
