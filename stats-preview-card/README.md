## About The Project

A perfect project for newbies who are starting to build confidence with layouts!
The main challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

The biggest challenge in this project was matching the image colors to the design. I tried to use blend mode however it never matched the original design. I tried to use overlay div with position absolute but it didn't help. Finally managed to find the way by using the blend mode right on the image itself instead of overlay div.

## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
