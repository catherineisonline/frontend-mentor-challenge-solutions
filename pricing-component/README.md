## About The Project

This challenge will get you thinking about building an accessible custom toggle control and also test your layout skills.
The challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard.
4. Bonus: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS.


I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

## What I learned

Another quick project to practice some JavaScript and CSS. Nothing new that I learned however decreased the timing to do the projects in general. Used to take much longer.


## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
