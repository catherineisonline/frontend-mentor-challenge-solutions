## About The Project

<p>Practice your layout skills with this article preview component. There's lots of fun to be had playing around with animations for the sharing icons as well.
The main challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The only JavaScript needed for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
<br>
2. See the social media share links when they click the share icon.
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

A very simple project to practice click events and class toggle. I learned a different way of handling event by using event target. Some time ago, functions were something I could hardly understand and had no idea how I could use them in practice Super glad to see that such small things are no big deal anymore.


## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
