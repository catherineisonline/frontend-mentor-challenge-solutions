## About The Project

A nice layout-based challenge for beginners. This will test anyone who is new to multi-column and responsive layouts.
The main challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

Another great project to practise some grid layout and flexbox. Hardest part was to make it pixel perfect and I had to add too much extra paddings and margins here and there. Another great challenge to practice some grid.
 

## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
