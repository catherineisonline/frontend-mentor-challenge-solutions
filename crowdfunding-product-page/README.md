## About The Project

This challenge will test both your layout and state management skills. As visitors make pledges, your goal is to keep track of the changes.



Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for interactive elements
3. Make a selection of which pledge to make
4. See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
5. See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
6. Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked



## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
