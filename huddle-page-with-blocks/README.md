## About The Project

This challenge is perfect if you're wanting to practice your layout skills. If you're starting to get a bit more confident laying out a web page, give this project a go.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid & Flex
- Mobile-first responsive workflow

## What I learned

A very easy project to keep updated with the Frontend Mentor projects and remember the basics! Decided to go with the mobile-first flow this time as I always do it desktop-first and needed some challenge.

## Useful resources

2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
