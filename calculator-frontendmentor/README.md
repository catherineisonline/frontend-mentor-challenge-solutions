## About The Project

<p>This calculator app will be a great test of your CSS and JS skills especially. If you're wanting to practice using Grid, this challenge will be perfect for you!
The challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>
1. See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
<br>
2. Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
<br>
3. Adjust the color theme based on their preference
<br>
4. Bonus: Have their initial theme preference checked using prefers-color-scheme and have any additional changes saved in the browser
<br>
<p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- React

## What I learned

I learned how to do simple math calculations using functions, condiitons and performing actions using keyboard. I also tried styled components for the first time, to achieve theme toggle funcionality. It turned out to be an amazing experience and I definitely would love to do some more project suing styled components.
