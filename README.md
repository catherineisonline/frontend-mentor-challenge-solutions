## About The Project

<p>A perfect project for newbies who are starting to build confidence with layouts!
The main challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
<br>2. See hover states for interactive elements</p>
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

This was one of the easier challanges I have done. The hardest part for me is always making images responsive enough so I am still mastering it.

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
