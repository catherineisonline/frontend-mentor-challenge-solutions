## About The Project

This challenge will test your ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites. It will also provide some nice basic layout challenges.



Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for interactive elements
3. View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links



## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first responsive workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

## What I learned

A very easy project to keep updated with the Frontend Mentor projects and remember the basics!

## Useful resources
