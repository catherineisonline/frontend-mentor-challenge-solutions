# News homepage


[Live]() | [Solution]() | [Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl)

Solution for a challenge from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)


## About The Project


The main challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

#### Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

Another great project to practise some mobile-first wworkflow and remember the basics!


## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
