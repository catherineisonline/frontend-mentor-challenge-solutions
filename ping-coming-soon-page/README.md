## About The Project
This challenge is great for beginners and offers a chance to practice basic client-side form validation.
The challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br>
3. Submit their email address using an input field.
<br>
4. Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty & the email address is not formatted correctly.
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

## What I learned

This was my first time trying out form validation. The hardest part which I never managed to fix is the error message disappearing too fast sometimes. At first I used setTimeout however seems like it triggers only once. I changed it to setInterval and it worked, however sometimes what happens is that it disappears very fast even though my timing number isn't that fast. I will eventually get back to this and try to find a different way. 

## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
