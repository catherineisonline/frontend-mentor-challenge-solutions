## About The Project

<p>This challenge is perfect if you're just getting started. The shift between the layouts will be a nice test if you're new to building responsive projects.
The main challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
<br>2. See hover states for interactive elements</p>
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

The project was fun to build and did not require a lot of experience. Making hover states was easy. A bit time consuming to make the card responsive for tablets but I believe I did fine. The only thing I deslike the most is how card changes height a little bit when I hover over the button and I found no solution how to fix this issue. I  am not even sure what causes it. I tried overflow: hidden but it does not help. Finally, I am still unsure which one I like more - desktop or mobile first versions.
